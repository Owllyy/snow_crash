Upon inspecting the file /etc/passwd, I discovered something noteworthy.

This file contains details about every user, including:
username:password:user_id:group_id:user_id_info:home_dir:command_shell

For the user flag01, the encrypted password is openly visible in this file:
flag01:42hDRfypTqqnw:3001:3001::/home/flag/flag01:/bin/bash -> 42hDRfypTqqnw

As for the others, the encrypted password is denoted by "x" and stored in the inaccessible file /etc/shadow:
flag02:x:3002:3002::/home/flag/flag02:/bin/bash

The password is encrypted using the system's "crypt" encryption (SHA-256 or SHA-512 since glibc 2.7).

To decrypt the password found in the file, I utilized JohnTheRipper:
```bash
echo "42hDRfypTqqnw" > pass && john pass --show
```
This yielded "abcdefg," enabling me to successfully connect to the user flag01.
