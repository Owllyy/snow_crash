I started by searching for information about the user flag00 using the 'find'command with the '-user' option
(find / -user "flag00" -print 2>/dev/null).

I discovered a file at '/usr/sbin/john' containing the code 'cdiiddwpgswtgt.'
Since this code wasn't enough to log in as flag00, I tried decoding it using the Rot13 algorithm.
I found a helpful tool at https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher, which tested different shifts.

After trying the 11th shift, the code turned into 'nottoohardhere,' granting me access to the flag00 user account.
