At the home of user level03, there is an executable file.

I used Ghidra (dogbolt.org) to disassemble it and discovered that it utilizes `geteuid()` and `seteuid()` before invoking `system()`. Its UID is flag03, so I can acquire the UID of flag03 for the command given to `system()`.

Within the `system()` call, there is "/usr/bin/env echo Exploit me". The strategy is to add another directory to the PATH, allowing me to write my own program named "echo".

I appended "/tmp:" to the Environment variable PATH in the first position.

Subsequently, I created this program at /tmp/echo:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
getflag
```

After executing the program as level03, it provided me with the flag.
